The goal of this project is classifying "loan_status" properly. There are several way to resolve a classification problem such as logistic regression, logistic regression with regularization, tree-based methods, SVM, neural networks, etc.

In this project, we focus on a neural network model, CATboost, LightGBM, and XGBoost models. We compare the methods with ROC-AUC values, choose the best model, and predict the test dataset with the best model.
